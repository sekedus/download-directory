> Download directory from a GitHub repo

GitHub doesn’t let you download a single folder from a repo, which might be necessary when you just need a few files from a large repository.

This tool will handle the download of all the files in a directory, in a single click, after you entered your token.

The download starts automatically when you visit pass the link to the GitHub directory as `url` parameter, like:

[**download-directory.github.io/**`?url=https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/build`](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/build)

You can also specify download filename by adding `filename` parameter, like:

[**download-directory.github.io/**`?url=https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/build&filename=three-js-build`](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/build&filename=three-js-build) to save the file as **three-js-build.zip**.

This is an alternative to the existing [GitZip](https://kinolien.github.io/gitzip/) and [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/) but without the cruft.

## Development Guide

To run the project locally or contribute, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/download-directory/download-directory.github.io
   cd download-directory.github.io
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This runs:

   * TypeScript in watch mode
   * Parcel dev server at [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234)
